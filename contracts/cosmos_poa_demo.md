# Cosmos PoA Demo

Demonstration for a Cosmos-based PoA chain. 
Possible steps:
1. Define a custom Cosmos module for AI or aggregator requests.
2. Expose transactions and queries to external users or other chains.
3. PoA validators handle off-chain AI/aggregator tasks, storing results on-chain.

This is only a conceptual example, not real Cosmos code.
